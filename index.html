86, 87, 88

September
	At this point, I can do the drive back to Binghamton with my eyes closed. The curves of 88 are familiar, even the potholes feel soft. The wheels on my ’08 Jetta slot into the passing lane and carry me home while my mind wanders. I feel like a passenger as the skyline – if you can even call it that – of Albany fades in the distance. None of the countryside I pass feels real – just the connective tissue between one world and the next.
	Still, the southern tier is beautiful at sunset. It’s almost October and the daylight is fading faster than I can keep up with. My eyes flicker between the battered road and the leaves getting plucked from trees by the autumn wind. I pass signs for Cobleskill, for Cooperstown, the little cities themselves feel further away than the memories I have of them. Trips with my parents as a little girl, then in cars with my friends, blasting music on the open road. Then with Jordan, back when we’d still do things like go away from the weekend.
 	I feel old all of a sudden, though I know it’s ridiculous, and the sensation is less scary than sad. Behind me, in Albany, Jordan is probably where I’d left – on the couch of the dumpy apartment he’d just moved into, ripping bong and playing the same videogames he had in college. And in Binghamton, where I’m heading, I bet Carolyn will be the same – waiting up on the couch watching TV like a mom whose daughter was out too late on a date, irritated I wasn’t home sooner. 
	I wonder if either of them actually miss me, or just the idea of me, the feeling of having another person, another body, nearby.
	I don’t mind being alone. In fact, over these past few weeks, I’ve almost come to love it. After the bustle of the beginning of college, the jockeying for friends and for boys and, eventually, for jobs, any quiet is like a drug for me, the rush so thrillingly fresh I consider never going back. The two-hour buffer of I-88 feels less like an obstacle than a welcome reset between my two lives. 
	So, I let my car drive itself while my mind wanders with the scenery. Old barns and exit ramps I’ve seen dozens of times before, all of it kind of pretty in that ugly, rust belt way. That this place doesn’t change is comforting to me, the way it asks nothing of anyone but to keep on moving.  
	I walk into our apartment just after eight and Carolyn is where I’d expected her, in the living room, though she lets me fumble with the lock myself. 
I thought you were going to leave at four, she says. 
Sorry, I say. I don’t want to argue. Carolyn and I have been having versions of this conversation since before Jordan and I even started dating. She knows that I know she’s never liked him. Once, that had bothered me, but now I can’t muster the enthusiasm to challenge her. I set my bags down and start to unpack.
Carolyn slides closer to me on the couch, asks more questions. Did you do anything fun this weekend? she asks. Her tone is neutral but I know her angle.
Same old, I say. Dinner at his parents’, went out for drinks, watched TV. I jogged in the mornings while he slept.
Carolyn rolls her eyes. Quantity time is different from quality time, she says. You know that, right? 
I don’t know what you expect me to say to that, I say, that I didn’t have fun? I grab a clean t-shirt and shorts from my duffel and stomp off to my bedroom, leave the rest of my stuff unpacked on the couch next to her.
Carolyn talks to my back as I leave. I just miss having you around, she says.
I slam my bedroom door.

October
	Sunday afternoons we go for long walks because there’s not time for anything else. In Albany, there’s a cemetery in Jordan’s neighborhood, one of those hundred-year-old religious ones tucked between run-down city blocks. Surrounded on all sides by squalor and yet, against all odds, almost beautiful. I think it’s telling that even generations after cities fall apart, it’s the Catholic stuff – mossy graves and big stone monuments – that are still standing. 
	I say this to Jordan and he nods. I can tell he’s not listening. God only knows what he’s thinking about, probably the sex we both know is coming. 
	Jordan doesn’t let me drive at night – chivalrous or condescending? I can’t tell – so as the days get shorter he’s kicking me out closer and closer to three, two hours before nightfall. These long afternoon walks are only the first step in a long dance that eventually ends back in Jordan’s room, one last fuck before it’s time to race the sun back to Binghamton.  
	But this time, when we leave the cemetery – follow its familiar twists and turns back to Jordan’s block – there’s none of that. Jordan lays down in his bed when we get inside, but I lay a hand on his chest, another on his cheek, he rolls over on his side instead of pulling me closer.
	What’s wrong? I ask him, thinking: what did I do? 
	Nothing, he says, then groans. My head just hurts. Sheepishly, after I prod him, he admits he’s still hungover. I hadn’t realized he had drunk nearly enough for that last night, but I’ve been missing a lot recently, haven’t it? Lost in my own head. 
	So instead of sex, I spend my last hour in Albany holding Jordan while he naps. And at ten to there, when it’s time to go, I kiss him on the forehead and carry my own bags to the door. 

November 
	Liza is the coolest person in Binghamton, which I tell her every time I see her. She’s 29 and a PhD student in poetry, works mostly as a TA for Brit Lit but runs the undergraduate workshop class I’ve been taking for three semesters now. Well, two semesters. The workshop she’s been running since August is on Thursday nights, meaning I’ve missed half of them driving to Albany. Liza called me into her office hours about my attendance.
	Are you okay? is the first thing she asks and I’m grateful for genuine concern on her face. We’ve become close over the past year, if not actually friends than certainly more than usual professor relationship. I’m not even that good of a writer, barely write any more poems than Liza’s syllabus requires, but the personal, conversational way Liza ran her workshop meant we all got to know each other well. I’d been into her office hours before, talking about music and movies and anything but school, really. Not like this. 
	You’re talking about missing class, I say. It’s not a question.
	I’m not going to fail you or anything, Liza says, so don’t worry about that. But where the hell are you? There’s only like eight of us, we can tell when someone’s missing. She smiles, tries to look reassuring, but I can see hints of worry in her eyes.
	Family stuff, mostly, I say, long story. But it should all be over soon, work itself out. I don’t add that the reason for it working out is that I’m not taking her workshop next semester.
	Well, that’s good, Liza says, but I can tell from her tone that she doesn’t buy it. Let me know if I can do anything to help you, she adds. 
	Thanks, I say, but I think at this point I just need time. I’ll figure it out.
	Liza leans forward, pulls off her glasses, her signal for the professor voice turning off. 
Look, she says, I know it’s school and you’re almost done so it’s easy to go on autopilot. But it’s supposed to be fun. Try and make the most of it, even the tedious parts.	
	I smile, nod.
	What’s next? she says. Grad school? 
	I shrug. Just focused on getting through this, for now, I say. 
Liza and I had talked in the past about jobs her world – if not as a poet than at least in books, at a magazine. Even six months ago it had seemed possible, internships I didn’t get but had at least interviewed for, the sensation of being on track for something. Now, I’m not so sure.
Liza frowns. Well, that’s fine, she says, but you’re smart, Em. Really. You could do something really cool if you set your mind to it. You just have to actually want to.
I smile, thank her for the advice, and excuse myself. I’m uncomfortable with what she’s told me because it’s exactly what I’ve been unable to do. 


December
	When Jordan is at my apartment, I mediate his and Carolyn’s fights, the jabs they take at each other in passing, waiting for the bathroom, or indirectly, talking to me while the other is in the room. 
	It’s the week before finals but for once I have no work. All those missed classes spent driving worked themselves out, I guess. Jordan had a little time off before the snowy season starts and so he’s spending the week in Binghamton with me, with us, though its too cold and cloudy to do much besides stay inside and watch TV.
	I don’t know how you do it with her, Jordan says. Carolyn had just stomped out the door in her sneakers and running clothes, said she’d be back in an hour even though it was already getting dark. Her and Jordan had been arguing, indirectly, about the TV’s volume, eyes locked on the screen instead of each other as they insulted each other. I don’t even remember what Jordan had even said to put her over the edge, but eventually Carolyn stood up, said she’d had enough, and was gone. I couldn’t even muster the energy to be worried about her, running in the nighttime, alone.
	We were a lot closer, once, I say. Then I lean down, rest my head on Jordan’s lap, enjoy the opportunity for intimacy as long as Carolyn isn’t home to gag when she saw it. 
	Yeah, well, making friends as freshmen doesn’t mean you should let her boss you around now, Jordan says.
	She’s not bossing me around, I say.
	Sure, says Jordan, in that snarky, detached tone I’ve come to hate, the way it deflects my doubts right back at me. You could’ve fooled me.
	I’m not, I say, but my voice betrays more emotion than I’d intended. 
	Either way, Jordan says, she’s judgy as fuck. And I bet you’re only showing this much backbone because I’m here. What if I wasn’t? 
	I sit upright. That was a really shitty thing to say, I tell Jordan.
	What? he says, it’s true. He shrugs, his eyes locked on the TV.
	I get up from the couch and walk to the kitchen. I want to put as much distance between Jordan and I as possible before I scream at him, before I slap him.
	Great, Jordan says, and you wonder why I hate coming back here so much.
	I wish I could go out then, too – run away from it all like Carolyn did, if only for an hour. But I can’t. Because Carolyn and I share running shoes, a pair of size nine New Balances we both pitched in fifty bucks for, and she’s got them on right now. I’m stranded. 	

January
	Jordan and his dad have run out to the liquor store, so its just his mom and I across from each other on either end of the kitchen island. She pours two tall glasses of chardonnay for us in fancy glasses, sets them between us like a biscuit to lure a timid dog back inside.  
	So how has school been? Anne says. She insists I call her by her first name. Her words are warm and interested but loud, overbearing in their own way. 
	It’s been alright, I say, I like my classes but I’m ready to be done. I swirl the wine around in the glass, don’t drink any yet. Behind Anne, her white cashmere sweater and bleached marble countertops, the Christmas tree in the living room is still up. Fake, with generic ornaments on it, more like a backdrop for a Christmas card photo-op than something in a home.
	And the job search is…? Anne lets her words dangle, not quite a question. She drinks. 
	I shrug. It’s going, I say, when in fact it hasn’t. I haven’t been doing much of anything since school ended. A week with my parents for Christmas, quiet and awkward as usual, and then staying in Albany, with Jordan, until school starts. In his apartment six miles away from his parents’ not-quite mansion, the apartment I know his dad helps pay for. 
	I know the feeling, says Anne, with a smile in her voice that I know is her, in her own motherly way, trying to be less like a mother to me than a girlfriend, a co-conspirator. The adult daughter she never got. Her eyes linger wistfully somewhere over my head. I studied English, too, she says, and graduated without a clue of what I was going to do. I thought I was going to work for a newspaper or something, as a reporter, but of course I just waitressed for years until I met Jordan’s dad. His mother was the one who first set me up student teaching, and, well, you know the rest…
	I smile, sip my drink. Anne is talking like she had a career teaching second grade, like she hadn’t stopped as soon as Jordan was born and only gone back after he went to college, part time, as a librarian’s assistant.  
	Anne reads my silence as interest. You haven’t thought any more about teaching, have you? she asks. I had mentioned to her once, years ago and in an effort to make her like me, that teaching was in fact one of the paths I was thinking about. Anne had never forgotten it, had clung to it actually, in an attempt to, in her own way, sculpt me into the daughter-in-law she wanted. 	The white lie has gone too far, I think, and I almost tell her right then I want no part of it. But I hear the hint of desperation in Anne’s voice, too, so I keep quiet, only say, tactically, that I’m trying to keep all my options open.	
	Anne nods, smiles, and we sit in silence for a little bit too long.
	Finally she breaks the silence. Well, she says, if you want me to introduce you to anybody, I know a few people. There are some good districts around here, a good place to build a career. 
She’s talking about Albany the way Jordan does, as if its not a pit-stop three hours from anything good, but not making it out to be more than it is, either. Instead, with the sort of unambitious undertone that says she’d never even considered being anywhere but here. I’m always confused when I hear either of them talk that way – with either a naivety or a self-assurance I could never have. 
	That’s very generous of you, I say. And then we chat about nothing, let time pass as we ignore the tension that has flooded the open-air kitchen. At least until the boys come back, with more booze, and we can go back to playing our roles. 

February
	I have a job interview today, through a combination of good timing and dumb luck. Not at a school – though Jordan’s mom has been on me about that, texting me contact information for Albany area administrators – but in New York, in books. It’s a marketing job for a children’s book company, offered off an application I’d sent to a portal weeks ago expecting nothing, filled out only because Liza had encouraged it. I’m not even sure I want the job but I make the drive to the city anyway, get in late Thursday night and crash at the apartment of a girl who graduated the year before me. 
	I don’t tell Jordan about the interview because it’s nothing – not yet, at least – and I know he’d take it the wrong way since it’s my turn to come to his place. I just tell him I have a paper due late Friday and that I’m not going to be able to make it to his place until Saturday morning. He grumbles about the change of plans, says we were supposed to go to dinner at his parents’ house, even though we go to dinner at his parent’s house every weekend. The tone of his texts are pissy but I don’t argue, pretend that I don’t pick up on how he’s feeling and tell him I’ll be there Saturday morning.
	On a Thursday night 86 East is empty. I drive through the Catskills imagining what a life in New York – the city, not this – would even be like. I’m not sure I can even see myself there, like one of those glamorous girls from old Vogues and Vanity Fairs. Typewriters and cigarettes all day, dancing and wine all night, never resting, always dressed to impress. I smile to my reflection in the rearview mirror, imagine my hair done up like it’s the fifties. It seems unrealistic and exhilarating at the same time.
	The drive is easy, despite the windy mountain highways. The road is at once familiar rand not – empty barns and giant neon truck stops, just not the ones I’m used to. Driving at night used to terrify me but now I almost think it’s the best way to enjoy the landscape, the tiny dots of light in the distance representing lives unlived. 
	I’m in Brooklyn by eight and by some miracle found a decent parking spot. I drink Franzia from the box with the girl who is letting me crash and we reminisce about Binghamton even though we were never really friends there, we just knew each other through Carolyn, and that I’m still there. In the morning I put on the closest thing I own to business casual and the girl walks me to the subway, where we each go our separate ways. Coming up the steps into midtown, I begin to think that I could actually do this, live here.
	Around the glamorous people of lower Manhattan, I’m invisible, enthrallingly so. I wander around streets I vaguely know to kill time before the interview at 11.
	At the publisher’s office the interview with the bosses goes well, and afterwards one of the assistants, a girl about my age, asks if I want to go out for a coffee. I’m not sure if its another unofficial part of the interview but I say yes anyway, boldened by how well the day has gone so far. 
	We spend the next two hours laughing about authors we both love and – more importantly – the ones we don’t. The assistant pays for our drinks with a gold AmEx with the company logo and when it’s time to go, she apologizes and hugs me on the sidewalk. Candidly, she says they have a few more interviews over the next two weeks but I can expect to hear back soon. Very soon. I walk back to the subway with a smile I can’t hide. 		
	I’m back in Brooklyn before three – hours until my friend gets off work – so instead I head back to my car. The day has felt long but it went much faster than I expected, no need to stay the extra night. So I turn my car on and follow the signs to 87 North, towards Albany. When I hit a red light, I send a text to Jordan, saying there was another change of plans, that I’ll be at his parents’ house before six.
